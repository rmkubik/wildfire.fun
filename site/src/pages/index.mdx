# Wildfire üî•

Wildfire is a mix up of Conway's Game of Life with a tile swapping mechanic. Your goal is to save as many houses as you can from being destroyed in the fire.

This project was originally created in an evening as a late entry to Ludum Dare 41 where the theme was "Mix two incompatible genres". Wildfire mixes tileswapping games and Conway's game of life. That older version of the game can be found on my Itch.io page.

I'm currently rebuilding it as a polished game using Redux to stitch together Phaser & React. Hopefully, it should be finished later this year with plenty of content and bundled with Electron as a downaloadble game on Itch.io.
