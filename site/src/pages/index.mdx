- **Swap** tiles to change the course of burning fires

- **Solve** a series of increasingly interesting puzzles

- **Challenge** yourself with optional, more complex puzzles

- **Discover** surprisingly deep interactions between many different tile types

- **Enjoy** a simple pixel art aesthetic

Wildfire is a puzzle game where you're presented with a grid of houses, trees, and fires. Each turn you're allowed to swap two adjacent tiles with eachother to try and move the houses to a safe position.

However, every time you make a swap, all of the fires on the map spread to nearby flammable tiles. Your goal is to create a fire break of cleared land between all the houses in a level and the surrounding flames.

## Keep Up to Date

## A History

The original prototype for Wildfire was created in an evening as a late entry to Ludum Dare 41. The theme was "Mix two incompatible genres". Wildfire mixes tileswapping games like Bejeweled and Conway's Game of Life.
