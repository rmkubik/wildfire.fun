Wildfire is a puzzle game where you swap tiles to contain raging forest fires before they destroy people's homes.

The original prototype for Wildfire was created in an evening as a late entry to Ludum Dare 41. The theme was "Mix two incompatible genres". Wildfire mixes tileswapping games like Bejeweled and Conway's Game of Life. [Play the original prototype of the game on Itch.io.](https://law5guy.itch.io/wildfire)

I'm currently building the full release desktop version of Wildfire. [Follow my development progress on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/ryrykubes) üê¶
