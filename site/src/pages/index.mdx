- **Swap** tiles to change the course of burning fires

- **Solve** a series of increasingly interesting puzzles

- **Challenge** yourself with optional, more complex puzzles

- **Discover** surprisingly deep interactions between many different tile types

- **Enjoy** a simple pixel art aesthetic

The original prototype for Wildfire was created in an evening as a late entry to Ludum Dare 41. The theme was "Mix two incompatible genres". Wildfire mixes tileswapping games like Bejeweled and Conway's Game of Life. [Play the original prototype of the game on Itch.io.](https://law5guy.itch.io/wildfire-jam)

I'm currently building the full release desktop version of Wildfire. [Follow my development progress on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/ryrykubes) üê¶
